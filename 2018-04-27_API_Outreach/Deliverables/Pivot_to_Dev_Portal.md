We are learning a lot from our interviews with Indeed and USAJobs about what kinds of outreach will be most effective. 

Through user research with these high-impact targets, we've learned that a developer portal is more impactful than branded collateral at this time.

So, as we discussed yesterday, we’re recommending pivoting our designer's time to creating a higher impact deliverable - the developer portal - even though it’s not technicallyoutreach collateral. 

Please let me know if you have questions!

Best,
Leanna


P.S. A couple of interesting quotes from interviews if you're interested:

 “... when the APIs came up that there are some that existed, I was referring to In the last five minutes, I was excitedly searching for what APIs are available. And to be honest, I was disappointed by the lack of information. I found out something about the Lighthouse API, but to see documentation, I need to sign up for an account to see if it’s worthwhile yet.”

“I think I ended up in the right places where there’s new about the VA going all in for APIs, but it doesn’t really seem that way. There’s nothing that’s really openly available about what APIs are there. It’s just: hey we have APIs.”
