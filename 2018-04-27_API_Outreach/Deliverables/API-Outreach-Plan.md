API Outreach Plan 

## Scope.

Lighthouse is a VA initiative to improve Veterans’ lives through easing the consumption and submission of VA and Veteran data. For this two-week engagement, we’ll identify one high-impact test persona and conduct user-research sessions with them to identify a targeted outreach strategy. We will deliver tailored outreach recommendations with metrics for success for the test persona and a research strategy to repeat with other types of partners. 

  

Remember, outreach is only the “marketing” component. For actual integrations to be successful, in addition to “lead generation” through outreach, there needs to be:

- Available high impact, and technically sound APIs 
- Teams at VA willing and able to open up their APIs in a user-friendly way 
- Good documentation for integration 
- Good support for onboarding external teams integrating 
- Good support for nurturing partnerships with external teams 

## The Plan.

* * *

### Week 1.

##### Step 1: Identify Potential User Types (Complete)

1. Highly visible industry partner with little to no previous experience with the VA (USAJobs, USAA, Indeed) 
2. Moderately visible industry partner with a lot of previous experience with the VA (Vetpro, Vetraspec) 
3. Owner of a high impact VA API (like MVI) 
4. Highly trafficked internal government partner (like Whitehouse Call Center) 

##### Step 2: Pick Target User Persona (Complete)

We suggest choosing a highly visible industry partners with little to no previous experience with the VA. More specifically, a recruiting company whom we assume is interested in a Veteran verification functionality gives us a discrete use case to test. Moreover, their potential impact on Veterans is high and it’s the persona we know least about.

  
  

##### Step 3: Declare Assumptions, Success Metrics (Outlined in Appendix 1) (In progress)

Because these users likely have little to no experience working with the VA, our assumption is that these users need a targeted outreach strategy before they will build integrations with VA APIs. We also have ideas about how we’ll assess the success of an engagement strategy. 

  

Through interviews with VA Lighthouse stakeholders and representatives of this user persona, we’ll seek to challenge and/or validate these assumptions so we can recommend an effective, user-research informed outreach strategy for this persona. 

##### Step 4: Conduct sessions with targeted persona

1. Participants (iterated over multiple companies) 
    1. 1 decision-maker 
    2. 1 product or developer 

##### Step 4: Synthesize Findings 

##### Step 5: Workshop with Lighthouse Team

Workshop and Discovery Readout with Lighthouse team to prioritize talking points that will resonate the most with this persona based on discovery interviews.

### Week 2.

##### Step 6: Create Collateral (Complete)

1. Tailored outreach strategy for this persona with success metrics based on validated assumptions. 
    1. Key roles/stakeholders to connect with 
    2. Channels 
    3. Messaging 
    4. Tone 

2. Plan for how to repeat outreach strategy research for other personas 

##### Step 7: Build a Backlog (Complete)

Create backlog and inventory of personas and associated APIs for use in larger outreach strategy.

##### Step 8: Conduct a Retrospective (Complete)

  

## Appendix 1.

Assumptions regarding User Persona Outreach

1. We believe these users will be best reached through targeted, direct outreach. 
2. We believe these users will need ongoing support and high quality documentation from the VA to consider integration. 
3. We believe that these users will want to prioritize a Veteran Verification API.  
4. We believe these users will know what kinds of VA APIs they’d be interested in working with. 
5. We believe that these users will want to support Veterans. 
6. We believe that the users will need reassurance from the VA and an improved reputation to consider integration. 
7. We believe that high-profile users within this persona will inspire others to integrate with VA APIs. 
  

Assumptions regarding User Persona Outreach Success Metrics 

1. Users’ willingness to integrate  
2. High-profile users willingness to integrate 
3. Users’ willingness to prioritize integration  
4. Users’ confidence in the VA to support API integration 
5. Users’ awareness of VA APIs available and to come.
