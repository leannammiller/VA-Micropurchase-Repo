## Script

### Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)

[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.]

  

Thank you for joining us today. As we talked about before, the VA is considering providing VA data in the form of APIs. We’re working with the VA to explore this option and talk to potential users of this API to better understand how the VA could implement an API solution that satisfies the needs of consumers of VA data.

  

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work:

- There are no right or wrong answers — and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. 
- [NAME] will be taking notes. We have to share what we learn from you with the rest of our team.  
- This conversation will last approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour. 
- Your participation in this discussion is voluntary. You may stop at any time. Your name will not be shared outside of this research team. 
- If it’s ok with you, we’d like to record this conversation today. Recording our discussion will help us capture everything you say accurately. 
- Remember, there are no right or wrong answers. We are here to learn from you. We really want to hear what you think. No idea or opinion is incorrect. 
  

Do you have any questions at this stage?

  

[The moderator will begin audio recording.]

### Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)

- Can you begin by telling me a little bit about the mission of your organization and your role? 
- Are you familiar with APIs? (Application Programming Interfaces) 
    - An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a flexible way to give and receive information  by allowing software systems to communicate with each other. In this case, the VA could provide a set of tools for providing appeals data that gives your developers all the building blocks necessary to automate collection of appeals data directly from VA’s system to your own. 

### Baseline Questions

- Before our team reached out to you, were you previously aware that the VA is publishing APIs? 
  

- (If applicable) On a scale from 1-10, how has your previous experience been working with the VA? 
    - Can you tell me a little bit about the interaction(s)? 
    - What communication channels did you use? 
    - What was successful or not sucessful about those interactions? 

  

- What veteran focused activities or initiatives do you engage in currently? What type of impact do they have on your organization, mission and veterans? 

### VA API Integration Decision-making

- Has your organization ever integrated or tried to integrate with an API? 
    - How did you find out about the API? 
    - How do you find out about new data initiatives for your organization? 
    - Have you ever actively seeked out API or general data initiatives? 
    - Have you ever actively reached out to organization whose data your interested in using? 
    - Where do you look for information on potential API or data integrations for your organization? (Blogs, Twitter) 
    - What types of marketing materials and tools did the organization provide throughout the process? 
    - What information do you need to make a decision on integrating with an API? 

  

In the API experience...

    - What are the major pain points in this process?
